## Introduction

Experimental support for Elasticsearch was added to uberAgent in version 3.6.0. This allows uberAgent to send data to Elasticsearch,
which can then be visualized in Kibana. This repository contains community dashboards for Kibana and OpenSearch.

It is part of our XOAP Automation Forces Open Source community library to give you a quick start into Infrastructure as Code deployments with Terraform.

You can read about the details here: https://uberagent.com/blog/uberagent-3-6-brings-support-elasticsearch/

We have a lot of Terraform modules, PowerShell DSC and Packer configurations that are Open Source and maintained by the [XOAP](https://xoap.io) staff.

## Guidelines

We are using the following guidelines to write code and make it easier for everyone to follow a distinctive guideline. Please check these links before starting to work on changes.

[![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-2.1-4baaaa.svg)](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

Git Naming Conventions are an important part of the development process. They describe how Branches, Commit Messages, Pull Requests and Tags should look like to make the easily understandable for everybody in the development chain.

[Git Naming Conventions](https://namingconvention.org/git/)

The Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages. It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history; which makes it easier to write automated tools on top of.

[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

The better a Pull Request description is, the better a review can understand and decide on how to review the changes. This improves implementation speed and reduces communication between the requester and the reviewer resulting in much less overhead.

[Writing A Great Pull Request Description](https://www.pullrequest.com/blog/writing-a-great-pull-request-description/)

Versioning is a crucial part for everything as code. Without version tags you cannot clearly create a stable environment and be sure that your latest changes won't crash your production environment (sure it still can happen, but we are trying our best to implement everything that we can to reduce the risk)

[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org)

## About uberAgent and ElasticSearch

The uberAgent does not deliver dashboards for Kibana or OpenSearch. So we at [XOAP](https://xoap.io) thought it would be a good idea to start with it.
We implemented a lot of dashboards in the past months and have decided to make those available to the community.
This way the community can collaborate on them and bring them to the next level together.

## Configure uberAgent for ElasticSearch / OpenSearch

The configuration for a Elasticsearch / OpenSearch connection is done in the uberAgent configuration file. The default location for the configuration file is:

```
[Receiver]
Name = Default
Type = Elasticsearch
Protocol = HTTP
Servers = http://servername:9200
# The setting RESTToken is required if X-Pack security is enabled. It is enabled by default since Elasticsearch version 8.
RESTToken = username:password
```

Read more about the ElasticSearch installation here: https://uberagent.com/docs/uberagent/latest/installation/backend/installing-elasticsearch/

### When Using Proxies

uberAgent uses [libCurl](https://curl.se/libcurl/) for communication/transfer.

So if you are using a proxy inside your company you need to configure the client as below:

- Two system variables have to be set in order to make uberAgent work with a proxy

    - http_proxy ***address:port***
    - https_proxy ***address:port***

You can set them easily with PowerShell:

```powershell
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("http_proxy", "$null", "Machine")
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("https_proxy", "$null", "Machine")
```

## Dashboards

This is the list of available dashboards.

> These dashboards are meant to be used in a local Kibana or a hosted OpenSearch instance.

### Analyze data over time

This dashboard lets you interactively analyze any filtered subset of your data over time.

We created more than one dashboard in Opensearch to show all the available data.

### Data Volume

This dashboard displays information about the volume of data generated by uberAgent. It is based on data from license_usage.log, stored in the _internal index on the Splunk license master. If this dashboard is empty, configure forwarding of the license master's _internal index to your indexers. In larger implementations the data volume cannot be determined per individual host due to squashing. Please note that enabling ESA also increases the UXM data volume because additional fields are populated in UXM sourcetypes, too.

![Data_Volume](./img/Data_Volume.png)

### Experience Score

This dashboard displays a high level overview of your environment. The lowest score is 0.0. The highest score is 10.0. The higher, the better. The data is updated every full and half hour. Click on a value of interest, to get a drilldown.
